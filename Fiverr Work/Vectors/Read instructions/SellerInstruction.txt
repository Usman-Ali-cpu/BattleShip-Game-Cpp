I have placed a video for running proj5.cpp file.
Do watch that video to how to run file 
If you already know then no need to watch 




if you want to file by run and compile main then go to main.cpp file and run that file 
it will asked first file name then it will execute program. 
if you are okay with proj5.cpp file than it's okay you can delete  main.cpp file.
