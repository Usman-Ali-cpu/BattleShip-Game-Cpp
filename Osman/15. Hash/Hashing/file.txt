Create a class called Hash. It should be able to implement a hash using 
either what we described as a "vertical" or "horizontal" hash. 
If a "horizontal" hash is chosen, it should be able to implement at 
least three of the hashing methods described in the accompanying 
PDF called hashing methods. It should be a fully developed class 
that can create a hashed data set, as well as implement all the methods 
that Java provides in its own HashSet class (Iterator, size, isEmpty, 
contains, add, remove, clear, clone - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashSet.html). 
Make sure to design it using Generics.
