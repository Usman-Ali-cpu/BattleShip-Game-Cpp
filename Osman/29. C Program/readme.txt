So we identify all the rush00 and program takes input from the 
standard input and identify which subrush00 was executed? Then 
run all the rushes against the input to see if anything matches?
So check matches, get the possibilities and then print the 
results as well as getting the dimensions?

You explained well above, you have got idea of program, i'm explaining it more
as you said identify which subrush00 was executed. Then 
run all the rushes rush00 rush01 and so on..., and also print 
result after checking comparity, as well as getting the dimensions


first of all program takes input from user, by using user input we 
will find dimensions, as we passed two int by referance in get dimension function 
by parsing it we will get cols and lines, as we have got number of lines 
and number of cols, so we call check option by passing these two variable 
in function to run rushes, first of all it call rush00, which 
prints lines by passing specific character to ft_printline that put in the output 
g_out_buf and end with endline,   from the check option, function will be call for 
printing results, by camparing output we got in g_out_buf, we input 
and output will be match that rushes printresult function will be called, 
as proceedure occurs for rush00 same as occurs for others. As rush01 is called, then check it input output match then print result function 
for rush01 will be called, 
Then rush02 is called, then check it input output match then print result function 
for rush01 will be called, same as for other and so on. 
As well as files are concerned, name of files of rushes are same of which function of
rush is inside it. where we want to used that function we include that file by 
include on th top.
As well as algorithm is concerned, in this program some algorithm are used, 
the famous by name, linear search algorithm is used for searching purpose, as we are matching input and outputs.
