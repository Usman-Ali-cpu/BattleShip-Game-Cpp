**After the table has been populated a function named update_table should be called that creates 
and runs SQL statements to do the following:

Julie King (id 4444) has retired, delete her from the table and display a message that 
the delete was successful.
James Krieger (id 6666) has been transferred to the Server component, 
update his component to reflect the transfer and display a message that the update has been successful.


Dana Duffield (id 1111) has reached his anniversary date,
 update his years_of_service to 26 and display a message that the update was successful.



 
After the updates have been completed, 
a function named query_table should be called that creates and runs the following queries:

Create a query to display the first_name, last_name, component and 
years_of_service with years_of_service &gt;= 10, order the query results by years_of_service in descending order.

Create a query to display the first_name and last_name of all developers who work on the JDBC component.
Create a query to display all information about all developers in alphabetical order by last_name. **
