Write a spell checker "class" utilizing class structure 
in objected oriented programming that stores a set of words, W, 
in a hash table and implements a function, spellCheck(s), 
which performs a Spell Check on the string s with respect to the set of words, W. 
If s is in W, then the call to spellCheck(s)
 returns an iterable collection that contains only s, 
 since it is assumed to be spelled correctly in this case. 
 Otherwise, if s is not in W, then the call to spellCheck(s) 
 returns a list of every word in W that could be a correct spelling of s. 
 Your program should be able to handle all the common ways 
 that s might be a misspelling of a word in W, 
 including swapping adjacent characters in a word , 
 inserting a single character in between two adjacent characters in a word, 
 deleting a single character from a word, and 
 replacing a character in a word with another character. 
 for an extra challenge, consider phonetic substitutions as well.
