· Initialise an empty 2D list to accept each student’s name, 
the mark and grade they obtained on a series of weekly tests. 
Ask the user to input as many names as they like, 
until they enter “End” instead of a name.

Slice the list in half and print the first half of the list. 
If the list contains an odd number of values, 
e.g., nine values, 
print only the first four values.
